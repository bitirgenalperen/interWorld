### 1. Overview

The ***InterWorld*** Web Application is designed to streamline property bookings, project management, and user engagement in the real estate sector. It provides a platform for users to browse real estate projects, book appointments, and manage their preferences, while offering role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure data security and appropriate access rights. It provides a centralized, user-friendly system that allows real estate managers, agents, and clients engagement in a secure and efficient manner.

#### 1.1. Features

- User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely using session-based authentication with Passport.js.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Roles are defined for clients, agents, and managers, with varying levels of permissions.
- Project Management: Managers can create, update, and delete real estate projects.
- Bookings: Users can book appointments for specific real estate projects with agents speaks their language of preference.
- Profile Management: Users can update personal information, including contact preferences and language selections.
- Multilingual Support: The app supports multiple languages: English, Chinese, Turkish, Russian, Urdu, Hindi, Malay, and French.
- Responsive UI: Built with React and Bootstrap for a clean, mobile-friendly user experience.

#### 1.2. Installation

Follow the below steps to install and run the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/real-estate-app.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd real-estate-app

# Install dependencies for both backend and frontend
npm install    # Frontend dependencies
cd backend
npm install    # Backend dependencies

# Set up environment variables (create a .env file)
# Example for .env file
DATABASE_URL=your_mongo_database_url
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# Start the backend server (from /backend directory)
node server.js

# Start the frontend React development server (from the root directory)
npm start

```

#### 1.3. Tech Stack

##### 1.3.1 Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  - Bootstrap: CSS framework for styling the app and ensuring a responsive design.
  - Axios: HTTP client to handle API requests.

- Backend:
  - Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
  - Passport.js: User authentication and session management.
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, projects, and bookings.
  - Mongoose: ODM for interacting with MongoDB.
  - Bcrypt.js: Password hashing for secure user authentication.

##### 1.3.2. System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is built with React and communicates with the backend server (Express.js) through a REST API. The backend manages user authentication, project data, and appointment bookings, while MongoDB stores all application data.

- Frontend: React app handles the UI and communicates with the server via API endpoints.
- Backend: Express.js with Passport.js for authentication, managing requests, and interfacing with the MongoDB database.
- Database: MongoDB is used for storing user information, projects, and bookings.

##### 1.3.3. Roles and Permissions (RBAC)

The application implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions:

- Manager:
  - Can create, update, or delete projects.
  - Can manage Agents by creating or removing their accounts.

- Agent:
  - Can update their own profile details except for the email and full name.
  - Must provide at least one language spoken and update contact details.

- Client:
  - Can update personal details such as communication preferences and preferred languages.
  - Can book appointments for any available real estate projects.

##### 1.3.4. Usage

- Sign-Up/Login:
  - Users can register via the /register endpoint by providing the details and language(s) of their preference, and after registration, they will be automatically logged in.
  - Existing users can log in via the /login endpoint using their credentials.
- Project Management:
  - Managers can create, update, or delete real estate projects via the /api/projects endpoints.
- Booking Appointments:
  - Users can book time slots for projects through the /api/bookings endpoint, providing an agent ID project ID and the desired time slot.
- Profile Management:
  - Users can manage their personal information. Agents and Clients must specify languages they speak can or want to communicate with. Clients can set communication preferences of either via Mobile Phone or Email.
